  <p>
   <p> This week we had to create and upload a placard for our project. After looking at the specifications for the sensors that we will be using we have
   a better understanding of what we will need to be using, power, and design of our project. For now the picture used is just a slight build, and there 
   is a good chance it will be modified in future weeks of the build.</p>

  <H2>Week 7</H2>
  <p>
   <p> This week we had to have our PCB working and successfully booted up. Once booted it the sensors should be plugged in
   and working after running a program on the Raspberry Pi. All my sensors were successfully working, and my LED also flashed.</p>
   
   <p>There was a problem at first with my PCB, but after going back to the prototype lab and testing again, I was able to get it working.
   The problem was with the 24-pin GPIO connector, pins 3 and 5 were actually short circuited by solder. This created an error with the sensors
   and when I ran the "i2cdetect -y 1" command, it wouldn't show the sensors being recognized.Once consulting Kelly Gray about it,
   he was able to fix it for me while looking under the microscope</p>

  <H2>Week 6</H2>
  <p>
   <p> By this week I updated my progress report that states all the things we have gone through from week 1 until now(which is seen below) and I also just recently completed soldering my PCB board and will go onto testing it.</p>

		<h4>Progress Report:</h4>
		<p>As of today there has been several changes to the initial plan of the hardware idea for Lifelines: the Portable Breathalyzer. After meeting
		with Kristian Medri about our proposal, we realized that a few things needed to be added and changed. Instead of going with just one sensor 
		that looks at your alcohol level, my group decided to also add a heart rate sensor that will monitor your heart beat. We also realized that 
		we needed to include a collaboration. We now are working in collaboration with the HRT (Hospitality, Recreation and Tourism) department 
		here at Humber college. We will be looking at all the sensors they have at their center and we will also be able to ask them any questions
		that we have uncertainties with.</p>
		<p>
		In terms of meeting the objectives based on the approval of our project proposal I am in pretty
		good standings. All the materials and parts needed for the project have either arrived in my 
		possession or are currently on their way. To avoid any time delays and full lab problems, I came
		to school during our reading break (Thursday Oct 6th) to work on finishing the PCB and solder all
		the things together.</p>
		
		<p>One problem that came up is with one our parts that are coming in. Our 7-segment display that
		we planned to include to display the readings will be coming in a month, which will impact the 
		budget building time. To fix this Kristian Medri suggested to talk to Vlad and Kelly to see what
		our other options are while waiting for these parts. In terms of finances, we were able to find
		cheap resources to include in our project since we will not be receiving any project funds.
		Either than the actual Raspberry Pi kit that we had to purchase and parts kit we bought in 
		first year, everything else was relatively cheap. My total budget including everything I bought 
		in the past came up to around $360, but removing the things I already had, I just needed to 
		spend a total of $63.69.</p>
		
		<p>In terms of moving forward, my group will be able to commence our project building plan.
		When looking at my designed GANTT chart, I can see that if I am able to follow my schedule 
		I will be able to complete it on time. My next step in this project is to go about the procedure
		to test the PCB board and make sure nothing is wrong with it. Lastly, as time goes on I plan to
		continue documenting any work that has been done, package openings, and assembly that will
		eventually make up my build video.</p>

  <H2>Week 5</H2>
  <p>
   <p> By this week we had to have ordered our parts needed for this project. All the parts
		that are still on their way need to at least have their proof of purchase.</p>

  <H2>Week 2</H2>
  <p> The proposal for our project was due this week. Groups were made and my group of myself Adriene and Ryan
  (Designated Drivers), plan to create a breathalyzer which we have planned to name "Lifelines: A Portable Breathalyzer"

  <p> In week 1, we worked with the raspberry pi to make the LED flash red, and green along with 
		text on a terminal saying so. </p>
