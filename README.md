Lifelines: Portable Breathalyzer Project
========================================

Project Website: [EugeneHasJeans.github.io](EugeneHasJeans.github.io)

 

Declaration of Joint Authorship
===============================

The team “Designated Drivers” which consists of Eugene Oliver, Ryan Do, and
Adriene Almacen confirms that the project of the Lifelines Breathalyzer is a
combined group effort and is a combination of our own thoughts and ideas. The
work of this entire project was split as equally as possible. Eugene Oliver
worked with calibrating the sensors and was in charge of hardware design and
working with the app layouts. Ryan Do worked with the database in terms of
setting it up, connecting it with the app and maintaining it. Adriene Almacen
was in charge of mobile application design and maintenance. The distribution of
testing the hardware and software for bugs and issues are discussed by the three
of us and worked on all together. Before any changes were done on the project, a
group consensus had to be made. All work that was used for guidance and help has
been acknowledged and cited in the reference area of this report.

Approved Proposal
=================

*Proposal for the development of Lifelines: Portable Breathalyzer*

Prepared by Eugene Oliver, Ryan Do, Adriene Almacen

Executive Summary
-----------------

As students in the Computer Engineering Technology program, we will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and actuators for testing and finding a user’s alcohol level.
The database will store information on past alcohol levels of the user, and
information on the legal alcohol levels in the province/state. The mobile device
functionality will include information, based on the found alcohol level, of
friends or taxis to call, GPS location to find the closest hotel and other
features. This will be further detailed in the mobile application proposal. We
plan to collaborate with the HRT – Hospitality, Recreation and Tourism
department here at Humber college.

The hardware was completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production Techniques
independently and the application will be completed in CENG 319 Software
Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent term in CENG 355
Computer Systems Project as a member of a 3 student group.

Background
----------

The problem solved by project is the frequency of people that drink and drive
and endanger their lives and the lives of others. Using the alcohol level
tester, people can realize how much alcohol is actually in their system and from
that can create a solution for their safety instead of going into a bad path.
Every year there is a call of help for people to stop drinking and driving, but
yet every year there are accidents that always lead to a common problem of
alcohol consumption. Studies have shown that out of all the young drinking
drivers who cause harm on the road, the largest age group is 19 years of age,
which is also a big age group for the use of technology and phones/gadgets. We
believe that the more people who use this project will lower the rate of this
problem and bring us one step closer to a solution for drinking and driving.

We have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” and have found and read three which provides insight into
similar efforts.

 

This first journal that was found talks about developing safety measures to
prevent and detect impaired driving. [@5976365]

 

The second journal talks about how to create a more precise heart rate reading
using formulas. [@6766706]

 

The last journal explains and talks about a certain sensor that measures the
alcohol concentration in a human.[@4418374]

 

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,  Wireless
    protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable us to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

Methodology
-----------

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:

Phase 1 Hardware build.

Phase 2 System integration.

Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

### Phase 1 Hardware build

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

### Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that we have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

Concluding remarks
------------------

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for the abnormal
amount of people that dangerously drink and drive above the alcohol limit. This
is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and skills developed in our program
to create a collaborative IoT capstone project demonstrating my ability to learn
how to support projects. I request approval of this project.

 

Abstract (Executive Summary)
============================

The purpose of this breathalyzer is to keep intoxicated drivers off the road. As
drunk driving is one of the leading causes of accidents on the road. This
breathalyzer can help eliminate drunk driving by determining the users blood
alcohol content (BAC) as well as their beats per minute (BPM), so that users can
determine beforehand if they are able to drive home safely. When the alcohol or
heart rate test is taken, data is retrieved from the sensors and stored on a
database. In addition, the data is also displayed on an android application
along with the date and time of when the test was taken. Furthermore, the
android application will aid the user by allowing them to determine if it is
safe to drive and will be given options such as calling a friend, calling a taxi
or seeking the nearest hotels in the area.

1. Introduction
===============

Alcohol and driving under the influence continues to become a major problem in
today’s society and every year, many lives are taken due to accidents caused by
drunk driving. Most people do not own a breathalyzer and many bars are not
required to carry one due to the high cost. The work described in this technical
report was undertaken because we wanted to try to create a solution where you
can track your Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) as well as your heart rate and
present the user with options depending on what range their BAC falls under. Our
breathalyzer connects to an android phone where our mobile app displays readings
and stores them into a database providing past history records to lookup in the
future. The mobile app provides user accounts to be able to synchronize data
across multiple devices and retrieve data from the database to display the
average values for the BAC and heart rate. After the user provides a breath
sample and a reading shows up, a choice is presented to the user to either call
for a taxi, call a friend, or find a hotel nearby.

 

2. Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)
=============================================

2.1 Technology Introduction
---------------------------

### 2.1.1 Purpose

The purpose of our Lifelines: Breathalyzer is to make sure people are off the
roads if they are intoxicated or not safe to drive. Drinking and Driving is a
huge issue in our world today, and by using this technology to check if there is
alcohol is someone’s body, we can keep lives out of danger.

### 2.1.2 Product Overview

This product is built using with a custom made PCB board, Raspberry Pi and two
main sensors. The MQ-3 Gas sensor is what we use when to check if there is
alcohol in your system. The XD-58C is what we use in our product to check your
heart rate.

### 2.1.3 Targeted Audience Group

Our targeted audience group would obviously be people over the legal drinking
age. This device would mainly be used for personal reasons, but in occasion you
can bring it with you if you were going to a party, or hosting one to make sure
everyone is safe to be behind a wheel.

 

2.2 Product Information
-----------------------

### 2.2.1 Main Functionality

The main functionality of the product is to test a user’s Blood Alcohol Content
(BAC) and determining if they are okay to drive home or not. If not, then the
user will be given a number of options such as calling a friend, calling a taxi,
or finding a hotel/motel to stay at for the night. The user can also measure
their heart rate as well to see if there is a correlation between their BAC and
heart rate.

### 2.2.2 Extra Requirements

This breathalyzer uses a rechargeable battery that allows it to be portable. No
internet connection is needed only Bluetooth connection. This connection allows
the device to connect to a user’s mobile device.

### 2.2.3 Best Performance

For best performance out of this technology you can consider a few things. To
get the most accurate reading the heart rate sensor should have a dark colour
behind it, because of the LED on the sensor it works better with dark areas.
Also, try not to move as much as possible because when steady you get more
steady readings.

 

2.3 Overall Description
-----------------------

### 2.3.1 Database

We will be using Google’s Firebase mobile and web application platform for user
authentication on logins and our real-time database. Users will be able to sign
up for an account and login to access their personal previous alcohol and heart
rate results, as well as the averages for both blood alcohol content and heart
rate. The database will be a JSON database which will contain the user’s unique
ID (UID) as well as user information that is taken from when the user signs up
for an account. Their UID is automatically generated by Firebase Auth when they
sign up for an account. Under their UID, holds their name, address, city, phone
number, province, and licence type. When they perform an alcohol test or heart
rate test, the resulting data is stored under their UID. The data is then
fetched and displayed showing the last 5 results and the averages when they
navigate to the past results page in the mobile application. (Developed by Ryan
Do)

### 2.3.2 Hardware

The hardware portion of our project is a breathalyzer. This breathalyzer will be
used to help eliminate drunk driving by giving the user the ability to test
their blood alcohol content (BAC) level as well as their beat per minute (BPM).
The device tells the user if it is safe to drive home or gives the user
alternative options if their unable to drive. The device uses two sensors that
help determine the users BAC and BPM; it uses an alcohol gas sensor and heart
rate sensor. The sensors are connected to a Raspberry Pi that runs a program
that gathers a reading from the sensor. The device itself is inside a small
acrylic case that holds the contents inside as well as a small rechargeable
battery to make the device portable. Data from the sensor are also sent to a
connected device and displayed on an application as well as sent to a database.
(Developed by Adriene Almacen)

### 2.3.3 Mobile Application

For our project, there will be a mobile android application which will be able
to show data collected from our Lifelines: Breathalyzer. Once the application is
open you must sign up and log in to be able to see past results which were read
from our two sensors on our hardware, MQ-3 Gas Sensor and XD-58C. Without
logging in/signing up, the past results button would be hidden, which leaves a
button to start the alcohol test or heartbeat test. After these tests, you will
be brought to a results page that presents the readings. If the reading from the
alcohol test detects alcohol in your body, it will give you options to take such
as calling a friend, calling a taxi or seeing hotels close by to you. The last
option you would have is to look at past results (if you are logged in). This is
where the data is taken from the database. The user will be able to look results
stored in the database which will show them their past BAC and BPM readings that
were done previously, along with their average BAC and BPM readings. If you are
logged in, once you run a test it would be added and updated to the database.

2.4 Future Considerations
-------------------------

### 2.4.1 Operating Environment

To be able to use our product, you would need an android smartphone or tablet
that is on android API 19 (Android 4.4 KitKat) or above.

### 2.4.2 Safety Considerations

In order to maintain safety when using this technology you must keep some things
into consideration:

-   Make sure to keep sanitation in mind when passing the breathalyzer around

-   Do not expose the technology to any liquids to prevent errors in accuracy or
    malfunctions

-   5 Volts DC is what should be used when providing power to the Lifelines:
    Breathalyzer

-   Be sure not to tamper with the technology while it is powered on

### 2.4.3 Future Additions

Before the end of the term, we plan on designing and cutting out a new acrylic
case to house the Raspberry Pi and the sensors we need. We plan on trying to
make this as portable as we possibly can, given the resources that are provided.

5. Progress Reports
===================

### Third Week of Winter Semester:

As of today we are currently on track with our project. Our project proposal
with inline citation has been submitted as well as both the skeleton, and our
software requirement specification. In the near future we plan to discuss our
project with the HRT – Hospitality, Recreation and Tourism department at Humber
College for guidance, help and additional planning.  
  
In terms of our actual project, everything is on schedule. The layout for our
Database and mobile application has been created and we just need to connect the
following to our Hardware. We plan on having the data from the alcohol gas
sensor and heart rate sensor display on our mobile application and store it on a
database.    
  
A problem that we have encountered and realized in the past weeks is that since
we are using Eugene’s hardware, the size of the acrylic case he made has his
name on it from last semester. It is also a bit large in size, and in order to
solve this we plan on creating a smaller more compact case. We also initially
planned to have out Brethalyzer as a portable device for users to move and bring
around easily. However, we currently power our Raspberry Pi with a Micro-USB
power adapter plugged into a wall outlet. To fix this issue, we are planning to
include a micro-usb portable charger to our budger/project that can power the
Lifelines: Breathalyzer.  
  
In regards to the budget, a small addition will be included in the future as we
will be ordering a portable battery so that we can power our Raspberry Pi and
make the device portable. This portable battery will cost somewhere between
\$20-\$30 for a power bank strong enough to power the Raspberry Pi.  
  
In the future, we plan to keep working on the things required to get us to the
end goal of our Lifelines: Breathalyzer, along with doing thing things to
complete our technical report. We hope in the near future to be able to merge
our database, mobile application and hardware into a complete working project.
