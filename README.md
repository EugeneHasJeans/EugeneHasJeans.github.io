Executive Summary
=================

As students in the Computer Engineering Technology program, we will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and actuators for testing and finding a user’s alcohol level.
The database will store information on past alcohol levels of the user, and
information on the legal alcohol levels in the province/state. The mobile device
functionality will include information, based on the found alcohol level, of
friends or taxis to call, GPS location to find the closest hotel and other
features. This will be further detailed in the mobile application proposal. We
plan to collaborate with the HRT – Hospitality, Recreation and Tourism
department here at Humber college.

The hardware was completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production Techniques
independently and the application will be completed in CENG 319 Software
Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent term in CENG 355
Computer Systems Project as a member of a 2 or 3 student group.

Background
==========

The problem solved by project is the frequency of people that drink and drive
and endanger their lives and the lives of others. Using the alcoholic level
tester, people can realize how much alcohol is actually in their system and from
that can create a solution for their safety instead of going into a bad path.
Every year there is a call of help for people to stop drinking and driving, but
yet every year there are accidents that always lead to a common problem of
alcohol consumption. Studies have shown that out of all the young drinking
drivers who cause harm on the road, the largest age group is 19 years of age,
which is also a big age group for the use of technology and phones/gadgets. I
believe that the more people who use this project will lower the rate of this
problem and bring us one step closer to a solution for drinking and driving.

We have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” and have found and read three which provides insight into
similar efforts.

 

This first journal that was found talks about developing safety measures to
prevent and detect impaired driving. [@5976365]

 

The second journal talks about how to create a more precise heart rate reading
using formulas. [@6766706]

 

The last journal explains and talks about a certain sensor that measures the
alcohol concentration in a human.[@4418374]

 

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,  Wireless
    protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

Methodology
===========

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:

Phase 1 Hardware build.

Phase 2 System integration.

Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

Phase 1 Hardware build
----------------------

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers
-----------------------------------------

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

Concluding remarks
==================

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for the abnormal
amount of people that dangerously drink and drive above the alcohol limit. This
is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and skills developed in our program
to create a collaborative IoT capstone project demonstrating my ability to learn
how to support projects. I request approval of this project.
