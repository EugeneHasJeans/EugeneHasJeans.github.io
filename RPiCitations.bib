abstract={Developing safety measures to prevent drunk and drowsy driving is a major technical challenge for the car industry. I have developed a system for this that involves the water-cluster-detecting (WDC) breath sensor. The WCD breath sensor detects breath by measuring electric currents of positively or negatively charged water clusters in breath that are separated by using an electric field. The WCD breath-alcohol sensor couples the WCD breath sensor with an alcohol sensor and simultaneously detects the electrical signals of both breath and alcohol in the breath. This ensures that the sample is from a person's breath, not an artificial source. Furthermore, the WCD breath sensor can detect breath from about 50 cm and can also test the level of alertness of a subject sitting in the driver's seat of a car. This is done by measuring the point of time at which the breathing changes from conscious, such as in pursed-lip breathing, to unconscious, such as when the driver becomes drowsy. This is the first result that one device has been used to detect both drunk and drowsy driving.},

title={Improvement of Force-Sensor-Based Heart Rate Estimation Using Multichannel Data Fusion},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to present and evaluate algorithms for heartbeat interval estimation from multiple spatially distributed force sensors integrated into a bed. Moreover, the benefit of using multichannel systems as opposed to a single sensor is investigated. While it might seem intuitive that multiple channels are superior to a single channel, the main challenge lies in finding suitable methods to actually leverage this potential. To this end, two algorithms for heart rate estimation from multichannel vibration signals are presented and compared against a single-channel sensing solution. The first method operates by analyzing the cepstrum computed from the average spectra of the individual channels, while the second method applies Bayesian fusion to three interval estimators, such as the autocorrelation, which are applied to each channel. This evaluation is based on 28 night-long sleep lab recordings during which an eight-channel polyvinylidene fluoride-based sensor array was used to acquire cardiac vibration signals. The recruited patients suffered from different sleep disorders of varying severity. From the sensor array data, a virtual single-channel signal was also derived for comparison by averaging the channels. The single-channel results achieved a beat-to-beat interval error of 2.2% with a coverage (i.e., percentage of the recording which could be analyzed) of 68.7%. In comparison, the best multichannel results attained a mean error and coverage of 1.0% and 81.0%, respectively. These results present statistically significant improvements of both metrics over the single-channel results (p <; 0.05).},

title={Clinical Evaluation of a Novel Interstitial Fluid Sensor System for Remote Continuous Alcohol Monitoring}, 
year={2008}, 
volume={8},

pages={71-80}, 
abstract={This study describes the functioning of a novel sensor that measures the alcohol concentration in the interstitial fluid (ISF) of a human subject. ISF is extracted using vacuum pressure from micropores on the stratum corneum layer of the skin. The pores are created by focusing a near infrared laser on a layer of black die attached to the skin. This poration procedure is essentially painless. Clinical studies show that the sensor readings are correlated with alcohol levels in blood and collected using a breathalyzer. Alcohol could be detected in the subject's ISF within 15 min of the first oral intake of alcohol. Tests in a laboratory setup show that the sensor exhibits a linear response to alcohol concentrations in the range 0%-0.2%. The sensor is minimally invasive and alcohol monitoring using the sensor was shown to continue even when the subject is asleep. The sensor is viable for approximately three days after skin poration. The sensor is interfaced to a wireless health monitoring system that transfers sensor data over existing wide-area networks such as the Internet and a cellular phone network to enable real-time remote monitoring of subjects.},
